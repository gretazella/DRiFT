# DRIFT: Debates on Reddit Involving Food Transition

Repository for the paper: "Dairy Milk" or "Plant-based Milk‚Äù? Language Shifts as a Thermometer of Social Change.

## Data

The "data" folder contains a sample of raw data collected from Reddit, the initial list of keywords retreived from policy documents, the list of policy documents, the selected subreddits, and a list of noisy keywords/phrases that were removed. It also contains neonyms and retronyms with relative pmw frequencies on which the bigram analysis was performed.

The automatic search for keywords on Reddit was based on the code from: https://github.com/okkyibrohim/getreddit/blob/main/getsubreddits.py.

## Scripts

For each of the following scripts, set the parameters inside of the code first. 

Data collection was performed based on the code taken and adapted from: https://github.com/Watchful1/PushshiftDumps/blob/master/scripts/combine_folder_multiprocess.py.
The code collects comments to posts from selected subreddits, and it creates a new jsonl.gz file every 100.000 lines, numbering them progressively. Posts themselves were not collected because they were not retrievable using Pushshift API at the time of our data collection.

```
1. scripts/data_collection.py
```

Comments are pre-processed and grouped by same subreddit and year. 

```
2. scripts/preprocessing.py
```

Corpora for diachronic (t0 and t1) and diastratic analyses are created.

### Corpus Study

to be added: frequency distributions are calculated and candidate words are selected based on them.

to be added: bigrams statistics.

## Lexical Semantic Change Detection Experiments:

The experiments on Lexical Semantic Change Detections are based on the code from: https://github.com/SanneHoeken/LSVD/tree/main.

## Connotation Experiments:

to be added: neonyms and retronyms are replaced with placeholders.

The experiments on connotation are based on the code from: https://github.com/valeriobasile/connhyp/tree/main.

The complete list of positive and negative seed words are added to the "data" folder.
