```

## Reddit Data Collection

Data collection was performed based on the code taken and adapted from: https://github.com/Watchful1/PushshiftDumps/blob/master/scripts/combine_folder_multiprocess.py.
The code creates a new zst. file every 100.000 lines, numbering them progressively. 

```
data_collection/parallel_process.py
```

## Preprocessing

Emojis are converted to text, usernames, subreddits' mentions, urls and emails are replaced with placeholders. 
Tab and html characters, as well as numbers, extra white space and other characters outside letters from a to z are removed.
Comments containing "i am a bot" or shorter than three words are also removed.

```
1. preprocessing/cleaning_comments.py
```

Separate files are created to group comments that belong to the same subreddit and year, numbering them progressively.

```
2. preprocessing/create_sub_files.py
```

Files representing same subreddits and years are grouped together into one unique file.

```
3. preprocessing/merge_sub_year_combinations.py
```
GENERIC and SUSTAINABLE communities are in turn created by merging subreddit files.

```
4. preprocessing/merge_communities.py
```
